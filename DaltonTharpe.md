I have not really learned much so far as I already learned a lot in my past years at Tech as well as high school coding classes.
Something I did learn doing the first assignment was the .strip(string.punctuation) method in the string class that lets you get rid of punctations which I found from google.
I also watched the crash course video as well as I have had a good amount of experience with GitHub from prior classes at Tech
