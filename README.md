## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dalton Tharpe and I am 21 years old.
I live in Virginia and my major is Cyber Security with a focus in Defense and Forensics
In my free time I spend my time playing video games and playing guitar
Most of my week is spent at Target where I am a manager for the front of store
I have worked at Target since I was 16 and it also pays for my school completely
In the past I attended Virginia Tech where I majored in Computer Science before I transfered to the University of Arizona
